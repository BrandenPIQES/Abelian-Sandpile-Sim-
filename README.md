# Abelian-Sandpile-Sim-
Parallelize a given serial implementation of the Abelian Sandpile simulation using the Fork/Join framework in Java and compare the execution times of the parallel and serial versions on different operating systems. The main objective was to determine if parallelizing the simulation is beneficial in performance.
